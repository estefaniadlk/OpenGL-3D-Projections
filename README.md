# OpenGL-3D-Projections
Projections of 3D objects onto a 2D plane, with a specific focus on the special cases of oblique parallel projections. (**Cavalier - Cabinet**)

In the initial stage, we discuss the categories of projections, describe the operating principles and distinctive properties of each one, examine their advantages and limitations, and present a practical example of applying the oblique parallel projections, Cavalier and Cabinet, to a unit cube. Subsequently, we present the implementation of the program within a computational environment. 

The program creates a window divided into three areas: one for perspective projection, one for Cavalier projection, and one for Cabinet projection. In each area, the program draws a unit cube, which can be interactively rotated in real-time around the x, y, and z axes. The code utilizes matrices for transformations and drawing commands for two-dimensional primitive objects. 

The OpenGL library in the C++ programming language is employed for the processing and rendering of the cube. Through the practical application of Cavalier and Cabinet projections on a unit cube, our goal is to deepen our understanding of these projections and become familiar with their interaction in a real-world environment.
